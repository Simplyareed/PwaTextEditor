## PWA Text Editor


## Description

This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) challenge that involves creating a text editor. The main motivation behind building this project was to develop a reliable and efficient tool for developers to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. This project addresses the problem of having a reliable and offline-capable text editor that can be used anytime and anywhere. Through this project, I learned about PWA features, service workers, IndexedDB, and bundling JavaScript files using webpack.
